# python_api_challenge
1. python_api_challenge contains 2 Jupyter Source Files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb 
2. The goal was to use the two API provideers OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify for over 500 cities in a given coordinates to generate information on weather including temperature, cloudiness, humidity and wind speed as one move away from equator. 
3. Graphs on relationship between latitude and these weather parameters were generated
4. Subsequent regressions equations and related plots were generated

5. The second task was to identify vacational locations on sample of cities identified from weather data. 
6. The potential cities were established followed by identification of hotels within 10000m of those cities 
7. Maps for both cities and hotels are generated and deposisted under Vacationpy folder
